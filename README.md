# kickstarter_analysis

Overview of Project:

  The purpose of this analysis was to learn the basics of Excel, and to familiarize working with a dataset that had "many" rows and columns. This analysis also introduced pivot tables, pivot charts, filtering, and countifs statements to display key findings on data 

Analysis and Challenges

For the task on tab "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" I displayed the data in a pivot chart and pivot table. I created 2 table filters (year and parent category) and narrowed the parent category to "theater." I then sorted the column labels "descending"

  The main challenge that I had was understanding the countifs formula. I overcame this challenge by watching the isntructional video and going to this website: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countif-function-e0de10c6-f885-4e71-abb4-1f464816df34
