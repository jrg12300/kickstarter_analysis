# kickstarter_analysis

Overview of Project:

  The purpose of this analysis was to learn the basics of Excel, and to familiarize working with a dataset that had "many" rows and columns. This analysis also introduced pivot tables, pivot charts, filtering, and countifs statements to display key findings on data 


Analysis and Challenges

  For the task on tab "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" I displayed the data in a pivot chart and pivot table. I created 2 table filters (year and parent category) and narrowed the parent category to "theater." I then sorted the column labels "descending." The pivot chart reflected this.
  
  For the task on tab "Outcomes Based On Goals" I created the row and column names, and filled in the values using countifs statements. This is very similar to a pivot table.

  The main challenge that I had was understanding the countifs formula. I overcame this challenge by watching the isntructional video and going to this website: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countif-function-e0de10c6-f885-4e71-abb4-1f464816df34
  

Results

  One conclusion I would make about the data set is that plays are more sucessful in the months May - July. Also, December is histroically the worst month to have a play, as it is almost as likely for it to fail as it is to succeed. 
  For plays that have a fundraising goal of $45,000 or more, there is only a 12% chance that you will hit your goal. When compared to the fact that 66% of plays (overall) hit their fundraising goal, I would keep my play's budget under $45,000.
  The limitation of the dataset is that we do not know who is giving the fundraising. The next step would be to get that data, and figure out which people are giving to which kickstarters, and creating a kickstarter that would overlap with the most donaters.
